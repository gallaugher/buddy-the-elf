Buddy the Elf Cutout waves, talks, opens candy box, controllable via cap touch + bluetooth

More to come:
Uses Adafruit CircuitPlayground Bluefruit, CircuitPython, a bunch of .wav files that I shouldn't distribute due to copyright (but this is a learning example, non-commercial, to be clear).
Also uses two standard 180 degree servos, alligator clips, bows are activated via touch with copper wire running under a wrapped piece of cardboard, with ends of wire clipped to alligator clips, clipped to CPB's touchpad.

Video build coming soon.
Code uses last Alpha of CircuitPython 5 for the CPB. Will update shortly to work with the CircuitPython 5 beta.
